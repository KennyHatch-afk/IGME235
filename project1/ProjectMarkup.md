## Intro
In Wehat simulator, you will fulfill your dreams of being a red panda.
You will wander the forests chasing small mammals and eating bamboo.
It is the perfect game for red panda fans.

## Proposal
### High Concept
The player plays as a red panda, wandering around the forest, eating bamboo and chasing small mammals.
As you play you get score, but it gets harder to remain full.

### Genre
*Adventure, Simulation, Arcade*

### Platform
*Desktop Only*

### Esthetics
The game has a simplistic cartoon artsyle, complete with cheery 8-bit music and cartoonish sound effects.

### Gameplay
The player controls the red panda, with WASD, moving it around the forest.
The player must eat bamboo or small mammals to fill up the hunger meter to survive.
The longer the player lasts the more points they get as well as the faster the hunger meter drains.
The player must choose when to prioritize the still but less filling bamboo or the fast, yet filling, mammals.
The player must also know when to prioritize surviving reliably with bamboo or to risk the higher score of the mammals under the ticking time of the hunger meter.
