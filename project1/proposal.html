            <h2 class="Titles">High Concept</h2>
            <p>The player plays as a red panda, wandering around the forest, eating bamboo and chasing small mammals. As you play you get score, but it gets harder to remain full.</p>

            <h2 class="Titles">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The player controls the red panda, with WASD, moving it around the forest. The player must eat bamboo or small mammals to fill up the hunger meter to survive. The longer the player lasts the more points they get as well as the faster the hunger meter drains. The player must choose when to prioritize the still but less filling bamboo or the fast, yet filling, mammals. The player must also know when to prioritize surviving reliably with bamboo or to risk the higher score of the mammals under the ticking time of the hunger meter.</p>
